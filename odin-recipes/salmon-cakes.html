    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced red bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced celery</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers</li>
            <li>1 ¼ pounds fresh wild salmon, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon panko bread crumbs, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <p>
        Heat extra virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, red pepper, celery, and a pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add capers; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Stir salmon, onion mixture, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, garlic, mustard, cayenne, seafood seasoning, salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl until well-mixed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firmed and chilled, 1 to 2 hours. Form salmon mixture into four 1-inch thick patties; sprinkle remaining panko bread crumbs over each patty. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook patties in hot oil until golden and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
